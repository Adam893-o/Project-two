      <h3>A Brief History Behind Planet Jupiter</h3>
      <p>Jupiter is the 5th planet in the Solar System and was discovered by astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610. He discovered it using a small telescope that he made himself. He realized that he had discovered Jupiter when he saw that the planet had four moons orbiting it rather than stars. This was a big discovery because people in the West always thought that the Earth was the center of the universe. With Jupiter's discovery, we finally realized that there are bigger objects out there in the universe, some of which are larger than anything we'd ever imagined.</p> 
      
      <p>Jupiter is the most important planet in our solar system because if it weren't for this gas giant, we would not be here. Our solar system is surrounded by an asteroid belt, and because Jupiter is located toward the center of our system, it uses its strong gravitational pull to suck in any asteroids that come toward us, <strong>destroying</strong> them with its powerful gravitational force.</p>

      <h2>Other Facts About Planet Jupiter</h2>
      <img src="media/image3.jpg" alt="Size comparison between Jupiter and other planets in our solar system">
      <p>You can fit 1,000 Earths into Jupiter and that would be the size of the planet. We are very <strong>very</strong> tiny compared to space.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Jupiter was named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology. Given that Jupiter is the biggest planet, it deserves that title.</li>
        <li>Those beautiful clouds surrounding Jupiter are actually extremely powerful storms.</li>
        <li>Unlike Earth, where storms stop due to land masses, Jupiter has no land since it's a Gas Giant. So, its storms will continue indefinitely.</li>
        <li>Jupiter is the fastest rotating planet in the entire solar system. One day on Jupiter lasts about 9 1/2 hours on Earth.</li>
        <li>Jupiter is mostly made of hydrogen and helium gas.</li>
        <li>Jupiter, like Saturn, has rings.</li>
        <li>Jupiter's great red spot is a gigantic cyclone, larger than Earth, and it has been raging for over three centuries.</li>
        <li>Because Jupiter is mostly made of hydrogen and helium gas like the sun, it is often called a "failed star" as it doesn't meet the conditions to become a star.</li>
        <li>Jupiter has many moons â€” around 95. The largest are <strong>Io</strong>, <strong>Callisto</strong>, <strong>Ganymede</strong>, and <strong>Europa</strong>.</li>
        <li>Jupiter's magnetic field is so strong that NASA's Juno spacecraft captured audio of what Jupiter sounds like.</li>

      <h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While we may never be able to see what's inside Jupiter due to the planet's immense power, we can still study and admire it for protecting us for so many years. However, nothing lasts forever; NASA studies have shown that the planet is shrinking. There are still many mysteries to discover about this fascinating planet, and we continue to explore what it has in store for us.</p>
